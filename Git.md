# Introduction #

Atomic-Dev uses Git and that will never change. Some have asked for Mercurial support. Sadly we cannot do this. If we add Mercurial support we also have to add Subversion support and so on. Doing all of this will make updating data much more complicated. It is smarter to stick to Git.


# Overview #

There are several important parts to this write-up that explain how to use Git to access our source-codes. The different ways of using it and which one better suits your interests.

Whether you are an amateur, home or experienced programmer you will need to access the Read-Only repository. Atomic-Dev members can access the Git repo and commit changes.

# Future #

Atomic-Dev plans on making code and projects available to everybody. This is what opensource is all about, giving all developers the chance to learn and help others. A huge online community.

# Graphical Access #

GitHub hosts our repositories; therefore you can access our code through the GitHub User-Interface. Fork over the repository(s) and feel free to build on them!

# Through Git #

Accessing our repositories with Git through the command-line is the easiest and most effective way for developers.

_**Atomic-Dev's version control system is Git.**_ Git repositories can be accessed through Git and/or GitHub.
